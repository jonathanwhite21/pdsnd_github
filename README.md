### Activating the Program
I created the program and the README file on OCT 7TH, 2022. To run this fil, you can input the python file in the Anacaonda's terminal window. This is the method I used to active this program. 

### BikeShare

### Description
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

This program allows the user to select what city of bike information they would like to look at it, sorts by the users preference of month, day, or day of the week. This program will also allow the user to see the data and the time duration of how long it took to see the data.
